Introduction
============

``candidateblock_bitcoin_library (cbl)`` is a OO Python package which aims to provide an easy and intuitive way of interacting with the Bitcoin protocol.

The current implementation has been developed in Python 3 and tested on a Mac.

Motivation
**********

As a experimenter/hobbyist in the field of Bitcoin, I wanted to write a Python package from scratch with miniumum dependances to better understand the Bitcoin protocol.

This package is intended to provide a quick, as well as (hopefully) easy to undestand, way of using the Bitcoin protocol with Python.

Limitations
***********

- The current version of :class:`candidateblock_bitcoin_library.decode_private_key_wif_compressed` has not been implemented
