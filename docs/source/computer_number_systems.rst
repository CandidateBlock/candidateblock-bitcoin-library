Computer Number Systems
=======================

A single digit in a computer is call a 'Bit'.
Bits are organised in to structures as multiples of Base\ :sub:`2` (Binary).
In the previous examples we have 8-Bits, which is called a 'Byte'.
The table blow shows as the number of Bits grows (multiples of base\ :sub:`2`) the names change.

Bits
****

+----------------+--------+
| Number of Bits | Name   |
+----------------+--------+
| 1              | Byte   |
+----------------+--------+
| 4              | Nibble |
+----------------+--------+
| 8              | Byte   |
+----------------+--------+


Bytes
*****

Once we get to 8 more more 'Bits' the naming convention switches to 'Bytes', which are made up of 8-Bits.
The table below shows as the number of Bytes grow the names change.

+-----------------+-------------+----------------+---------------+
| Number of Bytes | Name        | Number of Bits | Type          |
+-----------------+-------------+----------------+---------------+
| 1               | Byte        | 8              | Char          |
+-----------------+-------------+----------------+---------------+
| 2               | Word        | 16             | Int           | 
+-----------------+-------------+----------------+---------------+
| 8               | Double Word | 32             | Long Integer  | 
+-----------------+-------------+----------------+---------------+
| 16              | Quad Word   | 64             | Long Long Int |
+-----------------+-------------+----------------+---------------+
